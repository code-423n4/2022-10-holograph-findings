## `constant` Variables Should be Capitalized
Constants should be named with all capital letters with underscores separating words if need be. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/src/HolographOperator.sol#L30-L54
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L127-L131
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/module/LayerZeroModule.sol#L126-L146

Please visit the following style guide for more details:

## OpenZeppelin's Initializable
`init()` of `HolographBridge.sol`, `HolographOperator.sol`, `HolographFactory.sol`, and `LayerZeroModule.sol` uses `!_isInitialized()` to prevent re-initialization of the contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/src/HolographBridge.sol#L64
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/src/HolographOperator.sol#L142
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L144
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/module/LayerZeroModule.sol#L159

Consider using OpenZeppelin's Initializable which will have this scenario better taken care of. When a contract is initialized, its `isInitialized` state variable is set to true.

## Inadequately Commented Assembly Block
Assembly block is used in numerous contracts of Holograph. While this does not pose a security risk per se, it is at the same time a complicated and critical part of the system. Moreover, as this is a low-level language that is harder to parse by readers, consider including extensive documentation regarding the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what every single assembly instruction does. This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to verify it, and for developers to build on top of it or update it. Note that the use of assembly discards several important safety features of Solidity, which may render the code less safe and more error-prone.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/src/HolographBridge.sol#L325-L336
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/src/HolographOperator.sol#L571-L582
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/enforcer/Holographer.sol#L230-L241

## Use of `ecrecover` is Susceptible to Signature Malleability
The built-in EVM pre-compiled `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability due to non-unique v and s (which may not always be in the lower half of the modulo set) values, possibly leading to replay attacks. Devoid of the adoption of nonces, this could prove a vulnerability when not carefully used.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L333-L334

Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s ECDSA library which has been time tested in preventing this malleability where possible.

## Non-Assembly Method Alternative
Automated tools would typically flag a contract using inline-assembly as having high complexity, poor readability and error prone as far as security is concerned. As such, avoid using it where possible. For instance, the following block of codes could be replaced with:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L310-L313

```
bytes32 codehash = contractAddress.codehash;
```
Similarly, there is a newer syntax way to invoke create2 without assembly, you just need to pass salt and the contract constructor arguments just as in the following instance as an example:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/HolographFactory.sol#L235-L246

```
address sourceContractAddress = address(new <ContractName>{salt: saltInt}(<constructor argument(s)>));
```

## Lack of Events for Critical Operations
Critical operations not triggering events will make it difficult to review the correct behavior of the deployed contracts. Users and blockchain monitoring systems will not be able to detect suspicious behaviors at ease without events. Consider adding events where appropriate for all critical operations for better support of off-chain logging API. Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Add a Timelock to Critical Parameter Change
It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes with a mandatory time window between them. The first step merely broadcasts to users that a particular change is coming, and the second step commits that change after a suitable waiting period. This allows users that do not accept the change to withdraw within the grace period. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious Owner making any malicious or ulterior intention). Specifically, privileged roles could use front running to make malicious changes just ahead of incoming transactions, or purely accidental negative effects could occur due to the unfortunate timing of changes. Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Contract Owner Has Too Many Privileges
The owner of the contracts has too many privileges relative to standard users. The consequence is disastrous if the contract owner's private key has been compromised. And, in the event the key was lost or unrecoverable, no implementation upgrades and system parameter updates will ever be possible.

For a Holograph Project project this grand, it increases the likelihood that the owner will be targeted by an attacker, especially given the insufficient protection on sensitive owner private keys. The concentration of privileges creates a single point of failure; and, here are some of the incidents that could possibly transpire:

Change admin and mess up with all the setter functions, hijacking the entire protocol.

Consider:
1) splitting privileges (e.g. via the multisig option) to ensure that no one address has excessive ownership of the system,
2) clearly documenting the functions and implementations the owner can change,
3) documenting the risks associated with privileged users and single points of failure, and
4) ensuring that users are aware of all the risks associated with the system.

## Function Calls in Loop Could Lead to Denial of Service
Function calls made in unbounded loop are error-prone with potential resource exhaustion as it can trap the contract due to the gas limitations or failed transactions. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L307
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L323
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/contracts/enforcer/PA1D.sol#L356

Consider bounding the loop where possible to avoid unnecessary gas wastage and denial of service.

## Commented Code
Throughout the codebase `HolographERC721`, there are lines of code that have been commented out with //. This can lead to confusion and is detrimental to overall code readability. Consider removing commented out lines of code that are no longer needed.
