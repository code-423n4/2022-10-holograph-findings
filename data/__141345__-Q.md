#### Event is missing indexed fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

#### Events not emitted for important state changes

When changing critical state variables events are not emitted. Emitting events allows monitoring activities with off-chain monitoring tools.

  function setBaseGas(uint256 baseGas) external onlyAdmin {
  function setGasPerByte(uint256 gasPerByte) external onlyAdmin {
```

Suggestion:
Consider emitting events after sensitive changes take place, to facilitate tracking and notify off-chain clients following the contract’s activity.




#### Signature Malleability of EVM's ecrecover()

The `_verifySigner()` function calls the Solidity `ecrecover()` function directly to verify the given signatures. However, the `ecrecover()` EVM opcode allows malleable (non-unique) signatures and thus is susceptible to replay attacks.

Although a replay attack seems not possible for `deployHolographableContract()` since `holographerAddress` can only be deployed once per singer.

However ensuring the signatures are not malleable is considered a best practice. And it may become a vulnerability if used elsewhere.

Suggestion: 
Use the ecrecover function from OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library for signature verification. (Ensure using a version > 4.7.3 for there was a critical bug >= 4.1.0 < 4.7.3).



#### Missing Time locks

When critical parameters of systems need to be changed, it is required to broadcast the change via event emission and recommended to enforce the changes after a time-delay. This is to allow system users to be aware of such critical changes and give them an opportunity to exit or adjust their engagement with the system accordingly. None of the onlyOwner functions that change critical protocol addresses/parameters have a timelock for a time-delayed change to alert: 
- users and give them a chance to engage/exit protocol if they are not agreeable to the changes 
- team in case of compromised owner(s) and give them a chance to perform incident response.

```

Suggestion: 
Users may be surprised when critical parameters are changed. Furthermore, it can erode users' trust since they can’t be sure the protocol rules won’t be changed later on. Compromised owner keys may be used to change protocol addresses/parameters to benefit attackers. Without a time-delay, authorized owners have no time for any planned incident response. (May be medium since owner can change critical parameters at anytime that can affect the users poorly).
